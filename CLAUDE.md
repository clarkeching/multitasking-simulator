# Multitasking Simulator

## Project Info
- Simple HTML/JS simulation demonstrating the cost of context switching
- Single file: `index.html`
- Live site: hosted on Netlify (auto-deploys from GitHub)

## Workflow
- Don't push to GitHub until I say "deploy"
- Each push triggers a Netlify deploy
- Pull before starting if working from a different machine
